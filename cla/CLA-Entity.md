## 2. Grant of Rights

### 2.1 Copyright License

(a) You retain ownership of the Copyright in Your Contribution and have the same rights to use or license the Contribution which You would have had without entering into this Agreement.

(b) To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, You grant to Us a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, transferable, royalty-free, irrevocable license under the Copyright covering the Contribution, with the right to sublicense such rights through multiple tiers of sublicensees, to reproduce, modify, display, perform, and distribute the Contribution as part of the Material, provided that this license is conditioned upon compliance with Section 2.3.

### 2.2 Patent License

For patent claims, including without limitation method, process, and apparatus claims, which You own, control, or have the right to grant, now or in the future, You grant to Us a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, transferable, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license, with the right to sublicense these rights through multiple tiers of sublicensees, to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import, and otherwise transfer the Contribution and the Contribution in combination with the Material (and portions of such combination). This license is granted only to the extent that the exercise of the licensed rights infringes such patent claims and is conditioned upon compliance with Section 2.3.

### 2.3 Outbound License

(Option Five)
Based on the grant of rights in Sections 2.1 and 2.2, if We include Your Contribution in the Material, We may license the Contribution under any license, including copyleft, permissive, commercial, or proprietary licenses.

As a condition on the exercise of this right, We agree to also license the Contribution under the license or licenses which We are using for the Material on the Submission Date.

You acknowledge that We may commercially exploit the Material and
are not required to provide compensation to You for such use.

If moral rights apply to the Contribution, to the maximum extent permitted by law, You waive and agree not to assert such moral rights against Us, our successors in interest, or any of our licensees, either direct or indirect.

### 2.5 Our Rights

You acknowledge that We are not obligated to use Your Contribution as part of the Material and may decide to include any Contribution We consider appropriate.

Any rights not expressly licensed under this Agreement are expressly reserved by You.
